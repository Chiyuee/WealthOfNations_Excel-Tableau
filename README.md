# README: Wealth of Nations - Insights from Tableau & Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Wealth of Nations** dataset using both **Excel** and **Tableau**. The aim is to demonstrate proficiency in **data manipulation**, **Pivot Tables**, and **Tableau tools** to extract insights from the data, including economic trends, country-level wealth distribution, and other key metrics. The final outputs consist of visualizations, pivot table analyses, and summarized insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
1. **Excel**:
   - **Data Manipulation**: Cleaned and transformed the dataset for analysis (e.g., removing duplicates, filling missing values, restructuring data).
   - **Pivot Tables**: Used for summarizing data, calculating metrics, and organizing country-level information.

2. **Tableau**:
   - **Filters**: For isolating specific data (e.g., by country, year, or economic factor).
   - **Calculated Fields**: Created to derive new metrics (e.g., GDP per capita growth).
   - **Dashboards**: Designed to present a comprehensive view of the Wealth of Nations data.
   - **Maps**: Used to visualize wealth distribution and economic data on a global scale.

## üìä Key Excel Skills Demonstrated
1. **Data Manipulation**:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats to prepare the data for analysis.
   - **Transformations**: Applied operations like sorting, filtering, and restructuring data to create a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Pivot Table Creation**:
   - Built multiple pivot tables to summarize data such as **GDP**, **Population**, and **Income Levels** by country and region.
   - Used functions like **sum**, **average**, and **count** to derive summary statistics.

## üìà Key Tableau Skills Demonstrated
1. **Data Import & Preparation**:
   - Imported the dataset into Tableau and prepared it for analysis by cleaning and organizing fields.
   
2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Bar Charts**, **Line Charts**, and **Pie Charts** were used to analyze wealth metrics and trends over time.
   - **Geo-mapping**: Visualized wealth distribution across continents to provide a global perspective.
   
3. **Dashboards**:
   - Created interactive dashboards with multiple views to enable deep dives into country-specific economic metrics.

4. **Calculated Fields**:
   - Developed new calculated fields, such as **GDP per capita** and **Year-over-Year Growth**.

## üîç Insights Gained from the Data
- **Economic Disparities**: Significant income and wealth disparities were observed across different regions and countries.
- **Growth Trends**: Some developing nations showed rapid growth in recent years, driven by industrialization and population growth.
- **Globalization Impact**: Global economic shifts were seen, especially in emerging economies where wealth growth is accelerating.
